# E. coli Enzyme-Constrained Metabolic Model Optimization

This project is based on **[GECKO 3.0](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO)** and focuses on calibrating and optimizing the **E. coli** metabolic model (iML1515)

---

## 📌 About

- **Objective**: Optimize the E. coli metabolic model within the GECKO framework by applying protein constraints and kcat calibration, ensuring ecModel predictions align with experimental data.  
- **Base Model**: iML1515 (BiGG)  
- **Highlights**:
  - Integrates multi-source enzyme data, including **in vivo enzyme activities**, **BRENDA**, and **DLKcat**, to significantly improve kcat coverage.  
  - Completes **isoenzyme** information, enhancing enzyme redundancy handling and flux prediction.  
  - Enables exploration of overflow metabolism and key metabolic pathway regulation.
